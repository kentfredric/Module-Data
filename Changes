 [Internals]
 - Rework module discovery to be optimistic, check %INC if its there already, and if it is, report where it was found,
   otherwise, ask Path::ScanINC to tell us where it is WITHOUT loading it. This will hopefully be usefull in many cases
   allowing us to detect module availability without needing the compile/memory overheads of actually loading said
   modules
 - Rework ->version call to be optimistic, ask PACKAGE->VERSION for version if the package appears to be loaded,
   otherwise, fall back on Path::ScanINC to find the file, and Module::Metadata to extract the version out of it. The
   hope is that will eliminate the need to load the whole module permenantly into memory *just* to discern what version
   it is.

0.001 2012-03-23T15:37:57Z
